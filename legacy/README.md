# How it all Started

Within this directory are two files created for PyCon UK 2016. The "source"
ODT file works with LibreOffice, the resulting PDF worksheet contains a group
of self contained MicroPython on the micro:bit exercises.

These form the starting point for the Markdown content found within this
repository.

In case you were wondering, "Gradus ad Microbit" is Latin for "steps to
micro:bit". It's a silly joke, and if I need to explain it, it won't be funny,
will it? ;-)
